# cobalt-dl
this is a bash script for the [cobalt api](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt).
this isn't a replacement of some kind or a alternative. the script is just a cli tool to interface with cobalt.
# requirements
you'll need [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and curl. jq handles the json and curl handles the downloading of media. i will eventually replace jq with a bash only implementation.
# known problems
i haven't implemented picker types because i haven't had any use for them and the api documentation is quite mysterious about that. (ps you can probably just implement it yourself and make a pull request about that.
